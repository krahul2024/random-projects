1.nodejs can be connected with database but javascript can't be connected with database.
2.used for apis and server side programming.
3. apis are the main guys which connect frontend with database.
4.runs on v8 engine.
5. we get undefined in console or terminal that is cuz we have not defined anything or it doesnt return anything properly.
6.console.log in nodejs is not same as js console.log it is built same and used for debugging.
7.....core modules..
 global and non-global:-> console http fs buffer.
 read about these modules from mdn or node website
 
8.package.json file???????????????????
it keeps details related to project everything from commands, modules,packages and all. builds of projects and how to run how to test. basically all details related to code.
while installing modules in packages.json file we see that it has dependencies section after addition of package.it also keeps logs.
check npm i colors
npm i logs

package.json file == project if deleted then project is fucked.
is nodejs single threaded?
it runs one command at once.
if module folder is deleted then it is regenerated once package.json file is run.
whenever a project is pushed then we also push .gitignore file to ignore the upload of node_modules as their size becomes very large.
...nodemon :-> it runs continuously our project which saves time and we don't have to run ourselves the code everytime a change is made.to keep it refreshing automatically we have to once run using :-> nodemon ./filename.js.


APIs:-> these are messenger b/w two servers having req and response;

endpoint:- it is the url which needs to be called as we have to access some data from a server
paths:- suppose there are various categories of services , then if we use just endpoint then there might be errors so to solve this we have to add paths in endpoint.
parameters and authentication....

//TEMPLATING :-
let's say that we have a blog and we have to display several pages according to the situations 
then it will be problematic to make a hell lot of HTML files for each response so to avoid this bakchodi we use a concept called templating in which we create a template file and use  it by making changes according to our needs. also foe handling multiple if statements


how to add an error page using nodejs and any templating engines?
